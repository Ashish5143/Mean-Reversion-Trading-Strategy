# Mean-Reversion-Trading-Strategy

Mean reversion, or reversion to the mean, is a theory used in finance that suggests that asset price volatility and historical returns eventually will revert to the long-run mean or average level of the entire dataset.

Mean reversion, in finance, suggests that various phenomena of interest such as asset prices and volatility of returns eventually revert to their long-term average levels.

Reversion to the mean involves retracing a condition back to its long-run average state. The concept assumes that a level that strays far from the long-term norm or trend will again return, reverting to its understood state or secular trend.

Mean reversion strategies attempt to capture profits as the price of an asset returns to more normal levels, or the average. When considering using a mean reversion strategy in your trading, remember that a price rising away from the mean doesnâ€™t necessarily indicate that the price will fall. The mean could also simply move up to meet the price. That would also constitute reversion to the mean because the price is back in line with its average. While reversion to the mean occurs regularly, prices rarely stay exactly at the mean for long.

## Technical Indicators
Technical indicators like RSI can be used to find extreme oversold or overbought price levels. These can act as good levels to enter and exit mean reversion trades.
Standard deviation, Bollinger Bands, Money Flow, distance from a moving average, can all be used to locate extreme or unusual price moves. A good mean reversion indicator identifies extremes in prices that are likely to be temporary, not permanent.
